College application season is exciting—but let’s be honest, it can also be overwhelming. With looming deadlines, big decisions, and pressure from all directions, it’s easy for students (and parents/guardians!) to feel the stress pile up. That’s why it’s so important to take a step back and prioritize mental wellness alongside your academic goals.


May is Mental Health Awareness Month, making it the perfect time to talk about how to approach this process with intention, balance, and support.


For Students

Here are five actionable tips to help students manage stress and protect their well-being as they navigate the college application journey:


⏰ Create a Manageable Timeline

The application process feels more stressful when everything is left until the last minute. Instead of trying to do it all at once, break tasks into smaller steps and spread them out across the summer and early fall.


Use a planner or digital calendar to set realistic deadlines for things like requesting letters of recommendation, drafting your personal essay, and finalizing your college list. You’ll feel more in control—and less overwhelmed. If you’re working with an Admit U counselor, they’ll help you map this out based on your summer plans, senior year schedule, and school-specific application deadlines. 


💬 Talk About the Pressure

Whether it’s with a family member, teacher, school counselor, or friend, don’t keep your feelings bottled up. Talking about your worries can be incredibly relieving, and it’s a reminder that you don’t have to go through this alone.


🧘🏻‍♀️Take Breaks—and Actually Enjoy Them

Yes, it’s okay (and necessary!) to step away from work sometimes. Take time to do things you love—watch a show, hang out with friends, go for a walk, or even take a nap. 


When your brain has a chance to rest, you’ll come back to your work with more clarity and creativity. Burnout doesn’t help anyone—especially not your future self.


📵 Limit Comparison & Screen Time

It’s tempting to scroll through college decisions or classmate updates on social media, but that can often fuel anxiety and self-doubt. 


Instead, focus on your own path. Every student’s journey is different, and what’s right for someone else might not be right for you. Give yourself permission to unplug and stay grounded in your personal goals.


🌱 Redefine Success

Remember: college decisions don’t define your worth. The “best” school isn’t the one with the most famous name—it’s the one that fits your learning style, values, and interests.


Celebrate the hard work you’re doing and don’t lose sight of your own growth in the process. Trust that you’re building a future that’s right for you.


For Parents/Guardians

As a parent/guardian, it’s natural to want the best for your teen—but even well-meaning encouragement can sometimes feel like pressure. Here are five ways to stay supportive and reduce stress at home:


💡 Focus on effort, not outcomes: Celebrate the hard work your student is putting in, not just the grades or test scores. This reinforces healthy motivation.


📣 Keep the lines of communication open: Rather than discussing the admissions process daily and risking overwhelming your student, pick one day per week to check in. Agree upon the day with your child. Ask open-ended questions like, “How are you feeling about your college list?” or “Is there anything you want help with this week?” Then, listen with an open mind and offer support while giving your teen space. A balanced approach goes a long way. 


⏸️ Model balance: If you want your teen to take breaks, show them that you value rest too. A calm, supportive home environment makes a big difference.


🎯 Avoid over-scheduling: It’s tempting to fill every hour with test prep, essay support, and application work, but downtime is just as important. Give students space to be a teenager.


📘 Don’t go it alone: If the college process feels overwhelming for you too, lean on experts. Our consultants can help manage logistics so you can focus on being your teen’s biggest cheerleader.


A Closing Thought for Students & Family Members

College applications are important—but so is mental health. This May, as we recognize Mental Health Awareness Month, we encourage you to make space for both. With the right mindset, support, and planning, you can tackle this process with confidence and calm!
